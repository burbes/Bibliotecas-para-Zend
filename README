Installation and Autoloading
----------------------------------
Copy the folder `library/Noumenal` into your application's include path.
The Noumenal Library assumes that you have autoloading enabled.

If using ZF >= v1.9.0 register the `Noumeal_` namespace with the
autoloader in your bootstrap:

    $loader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    $loader->registerNamespace('Noumenal_');


Registering View Helpers
------------------------
Add the path and prefix for Noumenal View Helpers in your bootstrap.

Minimally:

    $view = new Zend_View;
    $view->addHelperPath('Noumenal/View/Helper','Noumenal_View_Helper');
